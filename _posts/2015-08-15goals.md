It's ironic that I'm sitting here at my computer when I tell myself I want to be someone adventurous, someone active and someone strong when I grown up. I think the truth is, I have no idea what I want to be in the future. All I know is I want to be happy, successful (and rich).
Being a thirteen year old in the country, there aren't many professions I can take, which is why I have turned to social media to earn me money.
Youtube can earn you thousands of pounds a day if you keep to it and produce what people want to see. This is precisely the problem, **keeping to it**, this is what I struggle most at. Fortunately I kind of enjoy filming my videos because it gives me a chance to talk when everyone is listening. Unfortunately it is incredibly boring editing videos. I have filmed many videos but only 3 have actually been uploaded to Youtube. Considering I only have 70 views it's not going to be any time soon I'm going to be approached be advertisers.
