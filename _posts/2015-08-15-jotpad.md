So I was having a chat with my mum and have concluded how I will earn money

+ Twitter posts'

Funny Twitter posts earns millions of likes and retweets. this is why companies pay money to tweeters to put in a good word about their products

+ Facebook posts'

I myself follow unilad and the lad bible. these pages earn millions of views.

I was thinking I could post memes and occasionally advertise for companies.

Memes never get old therefore I will not have to keep updating. they are easy to
make but earn many likes

+ Youtube

I am revisiting my youtube page but I am planning to do minimal editing.

Making videos' is fun and easy. I will cut down the editing but people may still
be interested as long as I am some use to them

+ Instagram

I am a great photographer and have earned a prize at school which was put on the timetable. Luckily I thoroughly enjoy photographer and could gain a lot of attention.

If I stick to these ideas I should gain attention fairly soon

I am thinking I could get a few friends to help out at school.
