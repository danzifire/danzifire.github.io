Someone once said money can't buy happiness, but how can one man define the rest of humanity's idea of happiness. What I'm saying is happiness applies to different people in different ways. if one man enjoys playing football does that mean the rest world does to?

being a 13 year old doesn't make earning money easy which is why I think I'm so desperate for it. The reason I have chosen social media to earn money is because:

# I am already familiar with social media

# I enjoy using it

# I don't have to do it everyday

# It's simple

# There is a lot of money in it if you work hard

# You can start at any age

However there are, like any profession, downsides to the business:

# Expensive to run eg: buy new equipment, keeping up with the latest crazes ect

# Depending on what type of media you use it can be slow

# It is totally dependent on other people

# You have to stick to it

That's my greatest problem is **_sticking to it_**
