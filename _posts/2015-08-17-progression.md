Out of all the accounts I've made, all the effort I have put into this; Youtube has been progressing the most.

I already have around 80 views now and each day there's a difference, my Balisong blade skills video had received 5 views in the first day of publishing.
The video that has progressed the most is my Battlefield joining server fix video, it has received 61 views so far.

Since Youtube has been making the biggest difference I think I shall concentrate on this the most.

I am going to ditch Facebook now as it's not working for me and has attracted nobody.

I shall keep tweeting and posting Norfolk pictures
