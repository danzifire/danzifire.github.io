Being a 13 year old who lives in the country, money isn't to easy to get,

which is why I have turned to social media to get the money I need. It is a

business I know and respect, I can work from home and at school and you don't

need to attend to it daily. It seems perfect for someone impatient like me.

This blog will show my written thoughts and ideas which will help me progress to
happiness and fame
