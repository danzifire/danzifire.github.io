Before I start blogging, it is not my intention to keep blogging for life as

I think I am too impatient to carry on that far. I have chosen to blog because I

want to  become famous. also I want to blog as it is my way of thinking. To me I

 am just having a chat to the world. I think talking out loud about a problem is

 the best way of solving it.
